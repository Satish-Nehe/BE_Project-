# BE_Project- Drug Traceability In Health Care Supply Chain Using Blockchain.

Drug traceability system is essentially important for public drug security and business
of pharmaceutical companies, which aims to track or trace where the drug has been
and where it has gone along the drug supply chain. Traditional centralized server-client
technical solutions have been far from satisfying for their bad performances in data authenticity,
privacy, system resilience and flexibility. We have proposed an entirely new
blockchain system for drug traceability. This system is more secure and scalable than
other alternatives on the market today. In addition, the proposed system is able to effectively
prune its storage, resulting in a finally stable and usable blockchain storage
solution.

Furthermore, the blockchain-based drug traceability system provides transparent and immutable
records of each drugâ€™s journey, ensuring the integrity of the supply chain and
safeguarding public health. By leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology,
the system eliminates the reliance on a single point of failure, enhancing system
resilience and minimizing the risk of data manipulation or unauthorized access. With its
enhanced privacy features, the proposed system protects sensitive information while still
allowing authorized stakeholders to access necessary data for regulatory compliance and
quality assurance. Overall, this innovative blockchain solution offers a robust and efficient
approach to drug traceability, addressing the limitations of traditional centralized systems
and advancing the security and efficiency of pharmaceutical operations.
